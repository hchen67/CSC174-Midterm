# CSC174-Midterm-hchen67

## Domain
The Domain of the midterm is British Iconic Musicians (Elton John, Ed Sheeran, Adele)

## Ontology
- Each musician has a info background
- Each musician has a musical career
- Each musician has multiple awards

## Taxonomy
- There are 2 webpages
- The home page is displayed in Z-Pattern, with titile, links to newsletter an subpages
- The subpage which is the content page is displayed in F-Pattern, with each musician's background, career and awards

## Choreography
I arrange the content from complexity to simplicity, from background to list of awards; The reason for my choice of British Musician is that I'm 1/4 British and I grew up listening to most of songs from Britain. Besides, the musicians in this assignment are all well-known and reader-familiar hence very digestible. The content kicks off with artist's background information, then follows the music career, these 2 categories have the similar amounts of contents so i arrange them in a horizontal direction. Next comes the award list which brings up some levity in a vertical way. The rest are the contents outside of the work from the webpage which consists of the footer and the subscribe button, so i put them both as footer.

## Application for Z-Pattern
The essence of Z-pattern is for reader to can from top left to top right, then down to the left side of the visible page, creating an imaginary diagonal line. So I'm putting the title at top left to demonstrate the importance, then follows the nav unit which provides reader some directionss. Then in the middle are some flashing visual clues about the content. Bottom left is the description of the assignment as footer whereas bottom right is the subscribe button.

## Application for F-Pattern
With F-pattern, reader starts reading horizontally in the first line of the webpage; in this case, it's the title and nav unit for my webpage. With this positioning, it gives reader directions of the website so they won't get lost. Next, reader would usually move down to the second horizontal element and here i have each artist's information. Besides, after reading all the background, there's list unit on the side which provides vertical element for the website.

## C.R.A.P Detail & Application
The characteristic of contrast is presented with different patterns in the webpage: the 4 corners in the home page and the slider in the middle. Besides, I make zoom in text for the title so it distinquishes more from other elements. The repetition is shown on the content page with F-pattern, each artist's information demonstrates a repetitive pattern. The alignment is also represented in the F-pattern. Moreover, in the content page, there's decent spacing in between each artist shows the concept of proximity. Also, since my content is large and there's always scroll bar appears on laptop's screen, I did some css to the scroll bar and makes it fit the content.

## Reason for Fonts
I pretty much change all the default fonts for my website. I use a unique and special font for the title so it could stand out more from other elements; the font shows in a fashionable and artistic style which sort of hints the musical content of the webpage. I use the Oswald font for most of the h2 and h3 tag because this font looks clean and modern. Besides, the font i use for the bottom left footer is also unique and it kind of shows a written style and it somewhat looks classy.

## Structure behind CSS Architecture
I apply SMACSS css architecture; it's not like other CSS framework, it's more like a set of rules and the default css tag colour of sublime text makes it easier to distinguish between each category, so it makes the whole css document looks tide and easily checkable. 

## Technical Things I could've done better
- I would want to figure out how to make the homepage fixed with no scroll bar.
- Somehow I couldn't change the background of my content page
