## Ontology

- Each musician has multiple awards

## Taxonomy
- There are 2 webpages
- The home page is displayed in Z-Pattern, with titile, links to newsletter an subpages
- The subpage which is the content page is displayed in F-Pattern, with each musician's background, career and awards

## Choreography
I arrange the content from complexity to simplicity, from background to list of awards; The reason for my choice of British Musician is that I'm 1/4 British and I grew up listening to most of songs from Britain. Besides, the musicians in this assignment are all well-known and reader-familiar hence very digestible. The content kicks off with artist's background information, then follows the music career, these 2 categories have the similar amounts of contents so i arrange them in a horizontal direction. Next comes the award list which brings up some levity in a vertical way. The rest are the contents outside of the work from the webpage which consists of the footer and the subscribe button, so i put them both as footer.

## Application for Z-Pattern
The essence of Z-pattern is for reader to can from top left to top right, then down to the left side of the visible page, creating an imaginary diagonal line. So I'm putting the title at top left to demonstrate the importance, then follows the nav unit which provides reader some directionss. Then in the middle are some flashing visual clues about the content. Bottom left is the description of the assignment as footer whereas bottom right is the subscribe button.

## Application for F-Pattern
With F-pattern, reader starts reading horizontally in the first line of the webpage; in this case, it's the title and nav unit for my webpage. With this positioning, it gives reader directions of the website so they won't get lost. Next, reader would usually move down to the second horizontal element and here i have each artist's information. Besides, after reading all the background, there's list unit on the side which provides vertical element for the website.
